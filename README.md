# **CHURN PREDICTION PROJECT**
## **Project Overview:**
In this project, I used data analytics and classification modelling techniques to generate insights on customer churn and predict customer churn for the company.


## 1.1 **Business Understanding**: 
Our company offers telecommunication service to customers spread across various location, the customers enjoy diverse billing tariffs and subscription packages.  
The company has been faced with significant drop in revenue despite implementing strategies to grow the customer base.  
Management is concerned about the customer churn and is seeking understanding of the customer behaviours to adopt proactive strategies to retain them at minimal cost.

## 1.2 **Business Objectives**:   
The aim of this review is to design a data driven model to help identify the factors that influence customers to exit the company.  
The model will also support the company management to identify customers who are likely to exit.  
The company management will then design initiatives targeting the possible exits to retain them such as offering promotions, reviewing quality of customer service  touch points etc.

## 1.3 **Model Success Metrics**:  
The prediction model should be able to capture at least 85% of all the customers who churn(Recall of **85%**).  
The model should be  have a high ability to exclude false positives and false negatives achieving an F1 score of at least **85%**.  
The project should also identify features that influence customer churn.
