 # **CHURN PREDICTION PROJECT**
## **Project Overview:**
In this project, I used data Aanalytics and classification modelling techniques to genreate insights on cusotmer churn and predict customer churn for the company.


## 1.1 **Business Undertanding**: 
Our company offers  telecommunication service to customers spread across various location, the customers enjoy diverse billing tariffs and subscription packages.  
The company has been faced with significant drop in revenue despite implementing strategies to grow the customer base.  
Management is concerned about the customer churn and is seeking understanding of the customer behaviours to adopt proactive strategies to retain them at minimal cost.

## 1.2 **Business Objectives**:   
The aim of this review is to design a data driven model to help identify the factors that influence customers to exit the company.  
The model will also support the company management to identify customers who are likely to exit.  
The company management will then design initiatives targeting the possible exits to retain them such as offering promotions, reviewing qulaity of customer service  touch points etc.

 # 2.0 **Data Understanding**:

## 1.3 **Model Success Metrics**:  
The prediction model should be able to capture atleat 85% of all the cutomers who churn(Recall of **85%**).  
The model should be  have a high ability to exclude false postives and false negatives achieving an F1 score of atleast **85%**.  
The project should also identify features that influence customer churn.
